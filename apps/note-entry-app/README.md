## note entry app
Proof of concept for note entry on mobile. Displays a base clef and a note -
click a different staff line or space to selelct a new note.

As part of a larger app you might select a note, click e.g. "Add to Melody",
and see the melody updated. Imagine this as the interface for the 'simple
melody app'. Instead of filling out textfields, you select the note visually,
etc.

### usage

So I don't spend 3 minutes figuring out how to use this every time I revisit it
after 2 years...

 ```
 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 
 ```

Browser to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever port was set for the python
server).
